README.txt for Drupal uc_migs module


DEVELOPER SETUP
---------------

If you are a developer and do not have a live MIGS account, contact the bank
you are setting up the site for, and request a set of development
credentials for testing.

Contact details will be provided in your bank documentation. For ANZ
Australia/NZ, the following PDFs have contact details which are correct at
time of writing.

THEME LAYER
----------- 

Some banks have various requirements for deployment. 

For example, ANZ / EFTPOS NZ requirements <http://www.eftpos.co.nz/developer> state that the VISA flag logo must be in full colour, and that the Verified by VISA and MasterCard SecureCode logos must be displayed. As this practice may vary from bank to bank and site to site, you will probably need to make some theme modifications to suit.

The uc_migs module provides theme functions for you to implement your banking requirements on your own site.



IMPROVEMENTS
---------------------

Improvements to this documentation are welcome, preferably in the form of a
patch submitted or issue submitted via http://drupal.org/project/uc_migs
