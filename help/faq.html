<dt>What is the difference between MIGS 3rd Party and MIGS Merchant Hosted?</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Third Party" means that the site visitor will be transferred to MIGS for the transaction. Your site never sees the payment details (eg credit card), which means less setup for you and more protection from exposure (a hacker can't steal information you never had from you).</li>
<li>"Merchant Hosted" means that the transaction occurs on your site, using MIGS API. You have more control over the user's purchase experience with this approach.</li>
</ul>
