INSTALL
---------------------

This module is a payment processor for Ubercart. You'll need Ubercart
installed and configured before you can use this module.

Once the module is installed and enabled according to standard Drupal
practice (see http://drupal.org/node/70151 for instructions) you need to
visit 
  Store Admin => Configuration => Payment Settings => Edit => Payment Methods
  ( admin/store/settings/payment/edit/methods )
and edit the details under "MIGS 3rd party settings".

You will need:
 * Your Merchant ID
 * Your Access Code
 * Your Secure Hash Secret

These details will be provided by your bank. If you have an existing MIGS
account you should be provided these, typically in two copies - one each for
live use and for testing.

If you are a developer and do not have a live MIGS account, contact the bank
you are setting up the site for, and request a set of development
credentials for testing.

Contact details will be provided in your bank documentation. For ANZ
Australia/NZ, the following PDFs have contact details which are correct at
time of writing.
