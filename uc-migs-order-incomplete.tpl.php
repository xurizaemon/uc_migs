<?php if ( $response_message != 'Order already completed.') : ?>
  <p>
     Sorry, your order (<?php print $order_id .', '. $receipt_no ?>) couldn't be processed for the following reason:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Error: <strong><?php print $error_message ; ?></strong><br /></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <small>Details of the error have been recorded in our site logs. You may contact the site administrator for more information.</small>
  </p>
  <p>
    You can try your order again with another payment method, or contact us for help.
  </p>
  <p>
    <?php print l('View your shopping cart to attempt payment again.', 'cart') ; ?>
  </p>
<?php else : ?>
  <p>
    It looks like your order (<?php print $order_id .', '. $receipt_no ?>) has
    been completed already, but somehow you've reloaded the order 
    confirmation page. This may not be a problem!
  </p>
  <p>
    You might just need to check the mailbox you used to place the
    order for further instructions, or contact the site administrator
    directly.
